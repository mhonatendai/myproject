                    <strong>Take Practice Exams:</strong> Practice exams are a great way to assess your knowledge and identify areas where you need to focus more attention. They can also help you get comfortable with the exam format and time constraints.

                <p>
                    <strong>Rest and Relaxation:</strong> Don't forget to take breaks and rest adequately. A well-rested mind performs better during exams.
